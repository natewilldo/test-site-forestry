I wanted to share about a time we went too far. Not too far in the sense that we reached a point of no return but too far in the sense that we went past to point of optimal good, joy, and fun. We were walking through the dense jungle of one of those central american countries, Honduras I believe. We had struck out in search of a waterfall we had seen from the road. We were walking a good two hours when someone called out that they think they see the falls.
